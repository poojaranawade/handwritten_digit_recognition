## Instructions to execute the code
1. Run using pretrained and saved model
  Run the file main.py and enter the file name for which you want to test the code when prompted (leave blank if you want to use my default   test file, images.png)
  python main.py
2. To train and save the model again uncomment line 10-11 in file main.py and run as above.
